**Fusion is an open-source lightweight user behaviour analytics and engagement pltaform.**

Its built upon a simplified low-code mixpanel like analytics engine with visual analytics, push-notification and email/micro-surveys.

Fusion shows how your users interact with your web based products eg: page-views, button clicks, form submissions etc. But apart from this, Fusion lets you engage with a specific user or group of user who have something in common or performed a particular action, in real-time with live-chat, in-app push notification, email/micro-surveys or set it up to trigger automatically.

## üöÄ Features

- **Event-driven** Fusion sends events from your application for user interactions.
- **Visual-driven** Fusion sends Visual Recording from your application for user interactions.
- **Product usage visualizations** Unlike of google analytics you choose/customize your graphs on your custom dashboard. As graph type (line, bar, pie, table, count), timescale(minute, hourly, daily, weekly), dashboard name etc.
- **Open-source** protect your user data, forget huge SAAS bills self-host on any infrastructure.

- **No-code autocapture** after adding tracking snippet to your website fusion automatically captures what your users are doing (eg: login clicked, pricing page-view, profile form filled) without adding extra code.

- **Ready-made libraries** for [JS](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fusion-analytics-js)
  coming soon: Node, GO, Android iOS, PHP, Flutter, ReactNative Elixir, API
